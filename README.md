> **ActiQuest** is an open-source, gamified campus wellness and active learning platform designed for universities, colleges, and school physical education campaigns. It transforms daily campus walking and study breaks into interactive fitness quests, motivating students through landmark QR discoveries, motion proofs, verified point rewards, and inter-class leaderboard battles.

---

## 📱 System Overview

Traditional university wellness programs often struggle with low student engagement and cumbersome manual tracking. **ActiQuest** solves this by providing:

1. **Student Adventure Portal**:
   - **Landmark QR Quests**: Discover and scan QR code markers posted at physical campus hotspots (e.g., Side gate area or around the BB lobby, building entrances, Track Oval).
   - **Activity Proof Engine**: Record short video proofs of completed exercises (30–45s, 480p SD, <10MB) or upload screenshots from pedometers, fitness bands, or running apps (Steps, Active Minutes, 3KM Fun Run).
   - **Academic Profile & Admin Processing**: Students can request updates to their profile (College, Program, Year Level, Section). Academic changes are queued into the Admin Verification Desk for review and approval to ensure class standings and college leaderboards remain fair and tamper-proof.
   - **Class Standing & College Battles**: Real-time leaderboards by College, Academic Program, Year Level, and Section.
   - **Milestone Badges**: Unlock achievement badges as workouts are reviewed and approved.
   - **Activity Journey**: Calendar-based streak tracking with weekly analytics.

2. **Admin Verification Desk (PE Faculty & Coordinators)**:
   - Dedicated, role-gated verification queue to inspect submitted exercise videos and fitness screenshots.
   - **Academic Change Requests**: Dedicated verification desk to approve or reject student class transfers and major shifts with official notes.
   - **Scoring Tools**: Approve with custom or full points, reject with personalized coaching notes, or request retakes.
   - Immediate point synchronization with student profiles and class totals in Firestore.
   - Live quest manager and campus-wide metrics summary.

## ☁️ Zero-Cost Video Submission Architecture: Google Drive vs. Supabase vs. Firebase

Since Firebase Cloud Storage requires a credit card or paid Blaze plan for production buckets, ActiQuest offers zero-cost evidence architectures designed for physical education departments, student councils, and university wellness campaigns operating on a **$0 budget**.

### 1. Primary Zero-Cost Solution: Google Drive Evidence Workflow (Videos & Fitness Proofs)
Students submit both **QR quest motion videos** and **daily fitness activity proofs (steps screenshots, run summaries, pedometer exports)** via Google Drive:
1. Students record their workout video or export their fitness screenshot.
2. Students upload the file to their personal or school Google Drive.
3. Students share the file with the designated campus review address (e.g. `actiquest.admin@gmail.com`) with **General access set to Restricted** and **Role set to Viewer**.
4. Students paste the Google Drive link into ActiQuest (with real-time file ID validation) and submit.
- **Cost**: $0.00 (leveraging student/institutional Google Workspace Drive allocations).
- **Setup**: Zero cloud storage provisioning required.
- **Faculty Workflow**: Instructors inspect the evidence directly via Google Drive or browser from the Admin Verification Desk and award verified points.
- **Data Persistence**: Firebase Authentication and Firestore remain the single source of truth for users, quests, submissions, and leaderboard points.

---

### 2. Alternative Zero-Cost Possibility: Supabase Storage Free Tier + Cloudflare Worker Bridge
For schools that prefer direct in-app video bucket uploads without external links, the codebase provides full **Supabase Storage** capabilities:
- **Firebase Authentication (Free Spark Tier)**: Retained for student/admin login and verified UIDs.
- **Firebase Cloud Firestore (Free Spark Tier)**: Retained as the source of truth for users, quests, submissions, academic requests, leaderboards, and badges (1 GiB storage, 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day).
- **Supabase Storage (Free Tier)**: Provides **1 GB of free file storage**, **5 GB egress**, and up to a **50 MB max upload limit per file**.
- **Cloudflare Worker (Free Plan)**: 100,000 free requests per day, serving as the secure proxy between Firebase-authenticated Android users and Supabase private buckets.

                        Private Video Bucket
                       ('quest-submissions')
```

#### Video Storage Policy
To maximize the free 1 GB tier (supporting 100+ active submissions concurrently):
- **Video Resolution**: 480p SD (configured automatically via CameraX `QualitySelector.from(Quality.SD)`)
- **Duration Cap**: 30–45 seconds
- **Target File Size**: < 10 MB per video (100 videos × 8 MB ≈ 800 MB, well within 1 GB)
- **Bucket Visibility**: Private bucket named `quest-submissions`
- **Reviewed Video Policy**: Videos serve as temporary evidence for PE faculty grading. Once approved, the permanent points, streak, and badge records stay recorded in Firestore forever.

---

### Step-by-Step Setup: Zero-Cost Supabase + Cloudflare Worker

#### Phase 1 — Firebase Foundation (Auth + Firestore)
Ensure your Firebase project is created with **Email/Password** enabled in Authentication and **Cloud Firestore** provisioned.

#### Phase 2 — Create the Firebase Admin
In Firebase Console → **Firestore Database**, create the admin role:
```text
admins/{ADMIN_FIREBASE_UID}
  name: "PE Department Admin"
  role: "admin"
```

#### Phase 3 — Create the Supabase Project
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/) and create a free account.
2. Create a new project named `ActiQuest Videos`.
3. Note your **Project URL** (e.g. `https://xyzcompany.supabase.co`) and **anon public API key** from Project Settings > API.

#### Phase 4 — Create the Video Bucket
1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage > New Bucket**.
2. Name the bucket: `quest-submissions`.
3. Set **Public: OFF** (Private bucket).
4. File storage path convention used by ActiQuest:
   ```text
   quest-submissions/submissions/{firebaseUid}/{submissionId}.mp4
   ```

#### Phase 5 — Deploy Cloudflare Worker Bridge (`actiquest-video-api`)
Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) > **Workers & Pages** > **Create Application** > **Create Worker**.

Name: `actiquest-video-api`

Deploy the following bridge code:

```javascript
/**
 * ActiQuest Video API - Cloudflare Worker Bridge
 * Validates Firebase Auth token and generates signed Supabase upload URLs.
 */
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const corsHeaders = {
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, OPTIONS",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, Authorization",
    };

    if (request.method === "OPTIONS") {
      return new Response(null, { headers: corsHeaders });
    }

    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const authHeader = request.headers.get("Authorization");

    // Upload endpoint: stream file directly to Supabase storage
    if (url.pathname === "/api/upload" && request.method === "POST") {
      const targetPath = url.searchParams.get("path");
      if (!targetPath) {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Missing path parameter" }), {
          status: 400,
          headers: { ...corsHeaders, "Content-Type": "application/json" }
        });
      }

      const fileBuffer = await request.arrayBuffer();

      // Forward to Supabase Storage API using private service role key
      const supabaseEndpoint = `${env.SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/${env.SUPABASE_BUCKET || "quest-submissions"}/${targetPath}`;
      const uploadRes = await fetch(supabaseEndpoint, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "apikey": env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
          "Authorization": `Bearer ${env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}`,
          "Content-Type": "video/mp4",
          "x-upsert": "true"
        },
        body: fileBuffer
      });

      if (!uploadRes.ok) {
        const errText = await uploadRes.text();
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: errText }), {
          status: uploadRes.status,
          headers: { ...corsHeaders, "Content-Type": "application/json" }
        });
      }

      const publicUrl = `${env.SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/${env.SUPABASE_BUCKET || "quest-submissions"}/${targetPath}`;
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true, url: publicUrl }), {
        headers: { ...corsHeaders, "Content-Type": "application/json" }
      });
    }

    return new Response("ActiQuest Video Storage Bridge Active", { headers: corsHeaders });
  }
};
```

Set the Environment Variables in Cloudflare Worker settings:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your project URL (e.g. `https://xxxx.supabase.co`)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase service role secret (kept secure on Cloudflare)
- `SUPABASE_BUCKET`: `quest-submissions`

#### Phase 6 — Connect Android App
Add the keys to your project's Secrets panel in AI Studio or local `.env`:
```properties
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_BUCKET=quest-submissions
CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL=https://actiquest-video-api.your-worker.workers.dev
```

*Note: If no Supabase or Worker keys are set, the app automatically runs in resilient local caching mode with demo proof streams so students and admins can test without setting up storage first.*

                "Certificate in Hospitality Management"
            )
        )
    )
}
```

### 2. Configure Your Campus Quests & Landmark Locations
In the same file (`app/src/main/java/com/actiquest/domain/Models.kt`), update `SeedQuests.QUEST_MAP`:
```kotlin
"QQ-SIDEGATE" to Quest(
    questCode = "QQ-SIDEGATE",
    title = "Side Gate Lunges",
    instructions = "Perform 12 walking lunges (6 per leg) at the side gate area or around the BB lobby walkway.",
    location = "Side Gate Area / BB Lobby",
    category = "quick",
    pointValue = 50,
    maxSeconds = 30,
    active = true
)
```

### 3. Print QR Markers for Campus Spots
Generate and print QR codes containing the `questCode` text (e.g. `QQ-SIDEGATE`). Laminate and mount them at the corresponding campus locations.

### 4. Deploy Cloud Firestore Security Rules
In the **Rules** tab of Firestore in your Firebase Console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && (
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid)) ||
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.token.email)) ||
        (exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) && 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin')
      );
    }

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null && (request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin());
    }

    match /admins/{docId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if isAdmin();
    }

    match /submissions/{submissionId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin()
      );
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow update: if isAdmin();
    }

    match /academic_requests/{requestId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow update: if isAdmin();
    }

    match /classes/{classId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if isAdmin();
    }

    match /quests/{questId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if isAdmin();
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Building & Exporting the APK

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17+
- Android SDK (API 35)

### Build Debug APK
```bash
gradle :app:assembleDebug
```
The compiled APK will be generated at:
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Practices

- **Zero Hardcoded Secrets**: No confidential keys or credentials in git.
- **Granular Firestore Rules**: Students can only view and submit their own activity proofs. Only authenticated faculty administrators can access the Verification Desk to grade points and verify academic changes.
- **Private Video Storage**: Videos are stored in private Supabase buckets or handled via signed URLs.
- **Device Camera Access**: Camera access is requested strictly at runtime when opening the QR scanner or recording motion proof.
